# The Similarity Implementation Plan

## Current State

Phase 1 complete + Phases 2a–2e done + Phase 3 done. Working tiered pipeline with 115 tests passing (all 9 methods active):
- Loader (CSV, parquet, DataFrame, dict, numpy)
- Normalizer (zscore, minmax, logreturn, logreturn_zscore, raw) with per-method defaults
- Windower (sliding windows, multi-scale indices)
- DTW matcher with Sakoe-Chiba band
- Bempedelis self-similarity transform (multi-start L-BFGS-B) — **integrated into pipeline**
- Scorer with `active_methods` + dynamic weight renormalization (0-100 scale)
- Projector with interpolated weighted quantiles and 5-band forecast cone (p10/25/50/75/90)
- Tiered matcher: SAX+MASS+Pearson prefilter → DTW+Pearson cheap scoring → Tier 2 enrichment (7 methods) on top-N → final rank
- `CandidateWindow` intermediate dataclass for pipeline state
- `SearchResults` container with `.best`, `.summary()`, `.matches`
- Full API contracts (Pydantic) with `SearchRequest`/`SearchResponse`
- FastAPI backend with live `/search` endpoint
- Playground with `run_local_search()` against real parquet data
- Data bank: stocks, crypto, forex, commodities (parquet, manifest catalog)

## Architecture Decisions (Locked In)

### Normalization Strategy
- Default: `logreturn_zscore` (log-returns → per-window z-score)
- Per-method defaults in `METHOD_NORM_DEFAULTS`:
  - Shape methods (DTW, Pearson, SAX, Matrix Profile, TDA): logreturn_zscore
  - Fractal/dynamical methods (Bempedelis, Koopman, Wavelet): logreturn
  - EMD: raw (needs untransformed data for decomposition)
- Each method normalizes independently per-window, never globally

### Data Alignment
- All matching done in bar-space (60 bars = 60 bars regardless of timeframe)
- Cross-timeframe is explicit opt-in: `search(..., cross_timeframes=["1h", "4h", "1d"])`
- Fractal methods are inherently scale-invariant, so this works naturally

### Active Methods + Weight Renormalization
- `Config.active_methods` controls which methods run (default: all 9 methods)
- `compute_confidence()` renormalizes weights across only active methods
- Adding a method to `active_methods` immediately gives it proper weight
- All 9 weight slots defined upfront; inactive methods don't drag score to zero

### Tier Architecture (Live)
- **Tier 1 prefilter**: `_score_prefilter()` — SAX MINDIST + MASS + Pearson blend (0.4/0.4/0.2)
- **Tier 1 cap**: `config.tier1_candidates` (default 1000) — top candidates by prefilter score
- **Cheap scoring**: DTW + Pearson on all Tier 1 survivors
- **Tier 2 enrichment**: 7 methods (Bempedelis, Koopman, Wavelet, EMD, TDA, TE, Regime) on top `config.tier2_candidates` (default 20)
- **Final rank**: `compute_confidence()` across all active methods → top_k returned

### Koopman Eigenvalue Distance
- Euclidean distance in complex plane: |λ₁ - λ₂| in ℂ (preserves phase info)
- Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment between eigenvalue sets
- Unequal set sizes: pad smaller set with zeros. Unmatched eigenvalues penalized by modulus
- Pre-processing: sort by modulus descending, truncate to top-k above |λ| > 0.05

### Caching (FeatureStore)
```python
class FeatureStore:
    def get_or_compute(self, window_id: str, method: str,
                        compute_fn: Callable) -> MethodResult:
        ...
```
- Key: (dataset_hash, window_start, window_length, method_name, method_params_hash)
- Phase 5: SQLite with params_hash in key (no explicit invalidation needed). Same interface.
- Precompute Tier 1 features on dataset load → search is O(N×lookup + K×compute)

### Stationarity / Regime Handling
- Lightweight regime tagger on each window (not a full solution, just a label):
  {trending_up, trending_down, mean_reverting, high_vol, low_vol}
- Based on: linear regression slope, Hurst exponent estimate, realized vol percentile
- Koopman matcher can optionally filter by regime (soft constraint, not hard)
- Phase 3+: replace with HMM or regime-switching model

---

## Phase 2 — Core Differentiators

### 2a. ~~MethodResult refactor~~ → DONE (via CandidateWindow)
- [x] `CandidateWindow` dataclass carries intermediate state through the pipeline
- [x] DTW and Bempedelis populate `ScoreBreakdown` fields directly
- [x] `MatchResult` stores transform_alpha, transform_beta, transform_r2 from Bempedelis
- [x] Matcher collects per-method scores and computes composite confidence

### 2b. ~~Bempedelis integration~~ → DONE
- [x] `bempedelis_match()` wired into `matcher.py` via `_enrich_with_bempedelis()`
- [x] Runs only on top `tier2_candidates` (expensive method, Tier 2 only)
- [x] Uses `METHOD_NORM_DEFAULTS["bempedelis"]` (logreturn) for Bempedelis normalization
- [x] Populates `score_breakdown.bempedelis_r2` and `bempedelis_smoothness`
- [x] Populates `MatchResult.transform_alpha`, `transform_beta`, `transform_r2`
- [x] Test: `test_bempedelis_reranking_populates_transform_details` passing

### 2c. ~~SAX pre-filter~~ → DONE
**Goal**: Replace the `_score_prefilter()` placeholder with SAX MINDIST — a distance that lower-bounds Euclidean, guaranteeing no false dismissals while eliminating ~80% of candidates.

**File**: `the_similarity/methods/sax_filter.py`

**Implementation**:
- [x] `sax_transform(series, n_segments, alphabet_size) -> NDArray[int8]`
  - Z-normalize input (already logreturn_zscore from pipeline)
  - PAA: divide into `n_segments` equal segments, replace each with its mean
  - Map each PAA value to an integer using breakpoints from `scipy.stats.norm.ppf`
  - Default: `n_segments=16`, `alphabet_size=8`
- [x] `sax_mindist(sax_a, sax_b, original_length, alphabet_size) -> float`
  - Build breakpoint lookup table for `dist(a, b)` between symbols (cached)
  - `MINDIST = sqrt(n/w) * sqrt(sum(dist(a_i, b_i)^2))`
  - This is a lower bound on Euclidean distance — no false dismissals
- [x] `sax_score(mindist, window_size) -> float`
  - Convert MINDIST to [0, 1] similarity: `exp(-mindist / window_size)`
- [x] Config additions to `Config`:
  - `sax_n_segments: int = 16`
  - `sax_alphabet_size: int = 8`
- [x] Wire into `_collect_candidates()` in matcher.py:
  - Compute SAX for query once
  - Compute SAX for each candidate window
  - `_score_prefilter` now uses 0.6 * sax_score + 0.4 * pearson (replacing Euclidean+Pearson)
- [x] `"sax"` in `METHOD_NORM_DEFAULTS` (already existed: `logreturn_zscore`)
- [x] **No pyts dependency** — implemented from scratch (~120 lines)

**Tests** (`test_sax.py`): 5 tests passing
- [x] `test_sax_identical_series` — same input → SAX distance 0
- [x] `test_sax_mindist_lower_bounds_euclidean` — for random pairs, MINDIST ≤ Euclidean distance
- [x] `test_sax_embedded_pattern_survives_filter` — embed pattern in noise, SAX prefilter retains it
- [x] `test_sax_transform_output_shape` — correct shape and value range
- [x] `test_sax_score_range` — output always in [0, 1]

### 2d. ~~Matrix Profile pre-filter~~ → DONE
**Goal**: Add MASS-based motif ranking as a second Tier 1 signal. MASS computes z-normalized Euclidean distance profile in O(n log n) via FFT.

**File**: `the_similarity/methods/matrix_profile_filter.py`

**Implementation**:
- [x] `query_profile(history, query) -> distances`
  - Pure-numpy MASS implementation (FFT-based sliding dot product)
  - No stumpy dependency — avoids numba JIT segfault issues
  - O(n log n) via FFT — computes all distances in one call
- [x] `mp_score(distance, window_size) -> float`
  - Convert to [0, 1]: `exp(-distance / sqrt(window_size))`
- [x] `mp_score_profile(distances, window_size) -> NDArray`
  - Vectorized score conversion for full distance profile
- [x] Wired into `_collect_candidates()` in matcher.py:
  - MASS computed once on normalized history (O(n log n))
  - Scores looked up by position for each candidate
  - Three-signal prefilter: `0.4 * sax + 0.4 * mp + 0.2 * pearson`
  - Graceful fallback to SAX + Pearson when MP unavailable

**Tests** (`test_matrix_profile.py`): 5 tests passing
- [x] `test_embedded_pattern_top_ranked` — embed pattern, MP ranks it #1
- [x] `test_mp_score_identical` — identical subsequence → distance ≈ 0, score ≈ 1
- [x] `test_mass_returns_correct_length` — output length = len(history) - len(query) + 1
- [x] `test_mp_score_profile_range` — all scores in [0, 1]
- [x] `test_mp_score_decreases_with_distance` — monotonic relationship

### 2e. ~~Wavelet Leaders multifractal spectrum~~ → DONE
**File**: `the_similarity/methods/wavelet_leaders.py` (190 lines)
- [x] Fractal spectrum analysis via wavelet modulus maxima
- [x] Multi-scale Hurst exponent estimation
- [x] Wired into `_enrich_tier2()` → `score_breakdown.wavelet_spectrum`
- [x] Tests in `test_wavelet_leaders.py` (5 tests passing)

### 2f. Tier 1 merger → DEFERRED
**Status**: Current 3-signal blend (0.4×SAX + 0.4×MP + 0.2×Pearson) works well. SAX provides no-false-dismissal guarantees. Nomination scoring deferred until backtester (4c) proves Tier 1 quality is the bottleneck. See TODOS.md.

### 2g. ~~Full confidence score~~ → DONE
